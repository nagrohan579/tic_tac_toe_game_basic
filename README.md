# Terminal Tic-Tac-Toe

Welcome to the Terminal Tic-Tac-Toe Game!

## Introduction

This is a simple terminal-based Tic-Tac-Toe game designed for two players to enjoy. It offers a classic and interactive gaming experience without the need for a graphical interface.

## Features

- Easy-to-understand gameplay.
- Players can input their names and choose their symbols (X or O).
- The game provides a clear display of the current board state after each move.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory.
3. Compile the Java code: `javac TicTacToe.java`
4. Run the game: `java TicTacToe`
5. Follow the prompts to enter the names of both players and select their symbols.

## Gameplay

- Players take turns to input their moves using row and column numbers (1-3).
- The game displays the updated board after each move.
- The first player to get three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
- If the entire board is filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.

## Future Enhancements

This game is a basic implementation to get you started. Here are some ideas for future enhancements:

- Implement a win/draw detection mechanism.
- Add error handling for invalid inputs.
- Enhance the board display for a more appealing look.
- Create a graphical user interface (GUI) version of the game.
